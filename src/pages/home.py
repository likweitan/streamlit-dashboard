Generation Alpha will be very different from traditional college students. Technologies will be largely driven in education and educators need to learn how to adapt to it. The traditional method of teaching and learning might not be effective and efficient for Generation Alpha. Institutional culture needs to be changed to prepare the arrival of Generation Alpha students. In a technology-driven period, students need to learn problem-solving skills to help themselves how to think not what to think, and collaboration skills to collaborate with peers around the world. What will the Generation Alpha students behave in higher education? How to define that an institution is ready to accept Generation Alpha? These questions can be answered by finding the unique pattern of generation z using predictive analytics. The proposed system is a dashboard that allows Higher Education Institution (HEI) to capture and analyse useful insights and improve decision making from the student data.")
